# CREATE
# These creates a new empty array named 'array'
When I create the new array

# INSERT
# The "insert" statement is used to append a simple object to an array.
# It's pretty self-explaining. 
When I insert 'myFirstString' in 'myFirstArray'

# LENTGH
# These two statements create objects, named "size" and "length" 
# containing the length of the array
When I create the length of 'mySecondNumberArray'
When I create the size of 'mySecondNumberArray'

# SUM 
# These two statements create objects, named "aggregation" and "sum value" containing the 
# arithmetic sum of the array, they work only with "number array"
When I create the aggregation of array 'mySecondNumberArray'
When I create the sum value of elements in array 'mySecondNumberArray'

# STATISTICAL INFORMATIONS
# These statements perform some statistical operations on the arrays
# These statements compute the average, the standard deviation and the
# variance of the elements of the array, saving them in three object named
# respectively "average", "standard deviation" and "variance", and
# they work only with "number array"
When I create the average of elements in array 'mySecondNumberArray'
When I create the standard deviation of elements in array 'mySecondNumberArray'
When I create the variance of elements in array 'mySecondNumberArray'

# COPY ELEMENT
# This statement creates a an object named "copy" containing
# the given element of the array
When I create the copy of element '2' in array 'mySecondNumberArray'

# REMOVE
# The "remove" statement does the opposite of the one above:
# Use it remove an element from an array, it takes as input the name of a string, 
# and the name of an array - we don't mix code and data! 
When I rename the 'myThirdArray' to 'myJustRenamedArray'
When I remove the 'mySixteenthString' from 'myJustRenamedArray'

Then print the 'mySecondNumberArray'
Then print the 'myFirstArray'
Then print the 'myJustRenamedArray'

Then print the 'length'
Then print the 'size'

Then print the 'aggregation'
Then print the 'sum value'

Then print the 'average'
Then print the 'standard deviation'
Then print the 'variance'

Then print the 'copy'
