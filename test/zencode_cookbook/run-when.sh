# HASH

# Output objects: as overwriting variables is discouraged in Zenroom, all the hashing
# and cryptography statements will output a new object with a hardcoded name, listed
# along with the statement. It's a good practice to rename the object immediately after
# its creation, both to make it more readable and as well to avoid overwriting in case you
# are using a statement with similar output more than once in the same script.

# The "create hash" statement hashes a string, but it does not hash an array!
# The default algorythm for the hash can be modified by passing them to Zenroom as config file. 
# Note that the object produced, containing the hashing of the string, will be named "hash", 
# which we promptly rename. The same is true for the two following statements.
When I create the hash of 'myFifthString'
And I rename the 'hash' to 'hashOfMyFifthString'

# In the same fashion, we can hash arrays

# Following is a version of the statement above that takes the hashing algorythm as parameter, 
# it accepts sha256 or sha512 as hash types
When I create the hash of 'mySixthString' using 'sha256'
And I rename the 'hash' to 'hashOfMySixthString'
When I create the hash of 'mySeventhString' using 'sha512'
And I rename the 'hash' to 'hashOfMySeventhString'

# Again, you can hash with sha256 or sha512 also arrays and dictionaries
When I create the hash of 'myFirstArray' using 'sha512'
And I rename the 'hash' to 'sha512HashOf:MyFirstArray'

When I create the hash of 'ABC-Transactions1Data' using 'sha512'
And I rename the 'hash' to 'sha512HashOfDictionary:ABC-Transactions1Data'



# The "create hash to point" statement can do some serious cryptography: 
# use it generating public keys from a secret key, where the secret key can be any random number.
# The statement accepts curves "ecp" or "ecp2" to produce the hash.
# This statement takes an array as input, and produces an array as output named "hash_to_point", which
# we immediately rename.

# AGGREGATE
# The "create the aggregation" statement takes as input an array of numers

# It works on both arrays and dictionaries, the data type needs to be 
# specified as in the example.
